# 🏆 StoryVerse AI - Hackathon Demo Guide

## 🚨 **Rate Limit Solution Applied**

I've fixed the quota issue by:
- Using `gemini-1.5-flash` for story generation (text only)
- Using `gemini-2.5-flash-image-preview` only for actual image generation
- This preserves your Nano Banana quota for the most important features

## ✅ **Current Status**
- **Server**: Running on http://localhost:3000
- **All APIs**: Gemini + fal.ai + ElevenLabs configured
- **Rate Limits**: Optimized for demo usage

## 🎯 **Demo Strategy**

### **For Maximum Impact:**
1. **Story Generation**: Now works with regular Gemini (no quota issues)
2. **Character Consistency**: Still uses Nano Banana for images (the key feature!)
3. **Audio Enhancement**: ElevenLabs provides professional narration
4. **Visual Enhancement**: fal.ai enhances all generated images

### **Perfect Demo Prompts:**
- *"A detective cat solving mysteries in Tokyo"* 🐱🔍
- *"A brave dragon learning to overcome fear of heights"* 🐲✨
- *"Two robots discovering friendship on Mars"* 🤖❤️
